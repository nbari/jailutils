jkill
=====

DESCRIPTION
-----------

 The jkill utility stops one or more jails in an orderly fashion. It calls the
 shutdown scripts inside the jail and then kills all remaining processes. When
 used with the -r option it can also restart the jail.

jkill can also be run from within a jail, to shutdown or restart
the jail. Replace the halt or reboot binaries in your jails with
jkill as a hard link. Each of these commands will then perform
their respective actions in the jail.
