.SH NAME
.B killjail 
\- stop or restart a jail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B killjail 
[ 
.B -h 
| 
.B -r 
] [ 
.B -t 
.I timeout
] [ 
.B -fq 
]
.I jailname ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B killjail
can either send signals to a 
.BR jailer (8)
process to manage the shutdown or restart of a jail or it can kill all 
the processes in a jail on it's own.

When no options are given the jail is shutdown as follows: 
.IP 1. 3
A stop request (SIGTERM) is sent to the 
.BR jailer (8)
process for the jail if there is one. This initiates an orderly shutdown. 
.IP 2. 3
Any remaining processes are killed with a SIGTERM.
.IP 3. 3
If the 
.B -f 
option is specified, send a SIGKILL to any remaining processes.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -f
Force jail to shutdown sending a SIGKILL as a last resort.
.IP -h 
Sends a halt request to a jail (SIGQUIT). The jail must have a 
.BR jailer (8) 
process running inside it. The 
.BR jailer (8) 
process remains running within the jail, but all other jailed 
processes are shutdown in and orderly fashion.
.IP -q
Supress warnings.
.IP -r
Sends a restart request to a jail (SIGHUP). The jail must have a 
.BR jailer (8)
process running inside it. 
.IP "-t timeout"
The timeout in seconds to wait between steps 1, 2 and 3 above. Defaults to 3.

.SH BUGS
I'm sure they're out there. Let me know.
